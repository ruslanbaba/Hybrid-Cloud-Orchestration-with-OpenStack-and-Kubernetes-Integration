# Security Policy for Hybrid Cloud Orchestration Platform

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for the Hybrid Cloud Orchestration platform with OpenStack and Kubernetes integration.

## üìã Security Framework

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture
- **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication for all access points
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for all services
- **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing security assessment and validation
- **Micro-segmentation**: Network isolation at the workload level

### 2. Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: HashiCorp Vault for centralized key management
- **Certificate Rotation**: Automated certificate lifecycle management

### 3. Access Control
- **RBAC Implementation**: Role-based access control across all platforms
- **Service Accounts**: Dedicated accounts for each service with minimal permissions
- **API Gateway**: Centralized authentication and authorization
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for pod-to-pod communication

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Incident Response

### Response Team
- **Security Lead**: Primary incident coordinator
- **Platform Engineer**: Infrastructure impact assessment
- **DevOps Engineer**: Service continuity and recovery
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory and compliance requirements

### Incident Classification
- **P1 - Critical**: Data breach, system compromise, service outage
- **P2 - High**: Privilege escalation, authentication bypass
- **P3 - Medium**: Configuration vulnerabilities, policy violations
- **P4 - Low**: Information disclosure, minor misconfigurations

### Response Timeline
- **P1**: 15 minutes detection, 30 minutes response, 2 hours containment
- **P2**: 1 hour detection, 2 hours response, 8 hours containment
- **P3**: 4 hours detection, 8 hours response, 24 hours containment
- **P4**: 24 hours detection, 48 hours response, 1 week remediation

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

- **TruffleHog**: Git history secret discovery
- **Ansible Vault**: Configuration encryption

## üîÑ Security Automation

### CI/CD Security Gates
1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated secret detection and security scanning
2. **Build-time Scanning**: Container and dependency vulnerability assessment
3. **Deployment Gates**: Security policy validation before deployment
4. **Runtime Protection**: Continuous monitoring and threat detection

### Security as Code
- **Policy as Code**: Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy enforcement
- **Infrastructure Security**: Terraform security modules
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible security playbooks
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance reporting

## üìã Compliance Framework

### Standards Compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Service organization controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards
- **GDPR**: General data protection regulation

### Audit Trail
