## Security Framework

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Identity Verification**: Every user and service must be authenticated
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal required permissions granted
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

### Defense in Depth
- **Network Security**: Multiple layers of network protection
- **Application Security**: Secure coding practices and runtime protection
- **Infrastructure Security**: Hardened infrastructure components
- **Data Security**: Data classification and protection

## Key Security Components

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all administrative access
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Centralized identity management
- **RBAC Integration**: Kubernetes RBAC with external identity providers
- **Service Mesh Security**: mTLS for service-to-service communication

### Policy Enforcement
- **Pod Security Standards**: Kubernetes pod security policies
- **Network Policies**: Micro-segmentation and traffic control
- **OPA Gatekeeper**: Policy as code with admission control
- **Compliance Policies**: Regulatory compliance automation

### Secrets Management
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Centralized secrets management
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Secure secret storage and rotation
- **External Secrets Operator**: Integration with external secret stores
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate lifecycle

### Security Monitoring
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized security monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Network and host-based monitoring
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuous security assessment
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails

## Compliance Standards

### Industry Standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry data security standards
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information privacy and security
- **GDPR**: General data protection regulation compliance

### Government Standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk-based cybersecurity framework
- **FedRAMP**: Federal risk and authorization management program
- **FISMA**: Federal information security modernization act
- **FIPS 140-2**: Cryptographic module validation standards

## Security Best Practices

### Container Security
- **Image Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning of container images
- **Runtime Security**: Real-time container behavior monitoring
- **Admission Control**: Policy-based admission control for containers
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal container capabilities and permissions

### Network Security
- **Segmentation**: Network micro-segmentation with policies
- **Encryption**: All network traffic encrypted with TLS
- **Firewall Rules**: Granular ingress and egress controls
- **DDoS Protection**: Distributed denial-of-service protection

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted when stored
- **Encryption in Transit**: All data encrypted during transmission
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Automated data protection policies
- **Backup Security**: Secure backup and recovery procedures
